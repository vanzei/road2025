# Golang

### First API Project KodeKloud

- After getting a grasp of the Go Programming itself, now we are developing a simple API using golilla/mux and using methods to implement the DB Initializer to create the connection string, and  StrictSlash to route the path.
  - In this project, we are using a constant,go file to sabe environment variables, but to me would be more interesting to understand where actually we create encrypted configuration files with this kind of data to be used by the services or static variable that are going tob e encrypted when compiled... **Things to review**

# BPF

### BPF Performance Tool Book

- Chapter 2 gives a "deep dive" on the technology background around BPF but without much details because examples and applications are going to be introduced later.
- Chapter 3 refreshes some of the learning of Book 1 ( Systems Performance ) and the methodologies like USE Method.

The Linux 60-Second Analysis is also a very good approach to remember and keep sharp understanding what it can show you:

- uptime
- dmesg | tail
- vmstat 1
- mpstat -P ALL 1
- pidstat 1
- iostat -xz 1
- free -m
- sar -n DEV 1
- sar -n TCP,ETCP 1
- top

Then it evolves to some of the BCC tools that cn be found in the BCC doc tutorial

- execsnoop
- opensnoop
- ext4slower
- biolatency
- biosnoop
- cachestat
- tcpconnect
- tcpaccept
- tcpretrans
- runqlat
- profile
